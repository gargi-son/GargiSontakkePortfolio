              <h2 class="text-center">Systems <span class="primary1">Programming</span> </h2>
              <p>&emsp;&emsp; These projects delved into getting a hands-on introduction to the systems level of programming with an emphasis on data structures 
                and interfacing with operating systems. It focused on fundamental data structures needed to design and implement systems applications. 
                It also touched upon Unix Application Programming Interface, signals, threads, and interprocess communications. <br>
                These projects were implemented  using C, with special topics in both Java and Python. Described below are a few projects along with the link to 
                their github repository.
                <br><br>
                <span class="primary1"><b>IPC System Function: </b></span><br> 
                <h5><b><span class="primary1"> Overview </span></b><br></h5>
                &emsp;&emsp;Most computers on the internet have a 32 bit Internet protocol Version (IPv4) address. 
                As reading these addresses would be difficult using binary or hexadecimal notation, IPv4 addresses are usually represented in dotted notation.
                For purposes of representation, the 32 bits composing the address may be divided into four octets written aas decimal numbers, each ranging from 
                0 to 255 and concatenated as a character string with a full stop(ASCII 46) between each number.
                For example,

                <div class="swiper-slide text-center">
                  <img src="assets/img/portfolio/sysprog.png" width="60%" height="60%" alt="Welcome Page image" >
                </div>
                <br><br>

                &emsp;&emsp; The first two components of the address indicate the computer’s locality on the network. In the above example, the locality is 
                specified by the ordered pair: <b>172</b> and <b>16</b>. Locally, computers are often known by an <b>alias</b> as well. 
                The goal is to design and write a program to process a list of Internet addresses from a file “CS531_Inet.txt”. For example, each line in 
                “CS531_Inet.txt” will contain an addresses/alias pair as shown below: <br><br>
    
                &emsp;&emsp;111.22.3.44 platte<br>
    
                &emsp;&emsp;131.250.95.21 jet<br>
                
                &emsp;&emsp;172.66.7.88 wabash<br>
                
                &emsp;&emsp;111.22.5.66 green<br>
                
                &emsp;&emsp;131.250.47.63 baker<br>
                <br>
                
                Each address and each alias within the file is unique. Alias names are NOT case sensitive.
                <br>
                <br>
                <h5><b><span class="primary1"> Program Structure and Design </span></b><br></h5>
                &emsp;&emsp; The program structure involved creating a structure type called address_t with components for the four integers of an IPv4 address 
                along with a fifth component in which to store an associated alias(key field) of up to 10 characters. I also created a singly linked list of 
                address_t structures which will contain all of the address/alias pairs read in from the the “CS531_Inet.txt” file. For this exercise, we consider 
                the linked list to be unsorted.<br><br>
                
                Once the linked list has been created, the next task is to present the user with the following options:<br>

                &emsp;&emsp;1) <b>Add address: </b> Prompt user for an IPv4 address/alias pair. Both data elements are read in from the keyboard as character strings. 
                The address string will be parsed and the four component integers will be stored separately (hint: use sscanf()). If either the address or alias 
                already exists within the list, display an error message and redisplay the menu.
                <br>
                &emsp;&emsp;2)<b>Look up Address: </b> Prompt user for an alias, and display the corresponding address. If the alias does not exist within the list, display 
                an error message and redisplay the menu.
                <br>    
                &emsp;&emsp;3)<b>Update address: </b> Prompt user for an alias and display the corresponding address. Allow user to update the address and have the newly 
                entered address replace the old address within the linked list *assuming* the new address does not already exist within the list. If the alias 
                does not exist within the list, or the newly entered address is a duplicate, display an error message and redisplay the menu.
                <br>    
                &emsp;&emsp;4)<b>Delete address:</b> Prompt user for an alias, and display the corresponding address. Confirm that user wishes to delete this node from the 
                linked list. If the alias does not exist within the list, display an error message and redisplay the menu.
                <br>    
                &emsp;&emsp;5)<b>Display list: </b> Display all address/alias pairs within the list. For this exercise, the list is unsorted. If the list is empty, 
                print a message to that effect and redisplay the menu. Also display the number of nodes within the list.
                <br>    
                &emsp;&emsp;6)<b>Display aliases for location: </b>Prompt user for an address location. (i.e. two separately entered values between 0 – 255). 
                If either value is out of range, reprompt. List all aliases that map to this location. If the location does not exist within the list, 
                display an error message.
                <br>    
                &emsp;&emsp;7)<b>Save to file: </b> Prompt user for a file name, and save the revised list to the specified file keeping file format consistent with that of 
                the input file (i.e. one address/alias pair per line.)
                <br>    
                &emsp;&emsp;8)<b>Quit:</b> Exit program
                <br>    
                <br>
                <b>The global variable structure used in the code is as follows:</b>
                <br><br>  
                    &emsp;&emsp;struct address_t 
                    <br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;{                
                    <br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;int octet[4];  
                    <br>   
                    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;char alias[11];   
                    <br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;struct address_t *next; 
                    <br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;}
                    <br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;struct address_t *head = NULL;
                    
                <br><br>
                <h5><b><span class="primary1"> Binary Search Tree</span></b><br></h5>
                   
                    &emsp;&emsp; The overall structure of this project is similar to the previous one. The only change is in the Linked list. 
                    Here, the linked list was replaced with a Binary Search Tree(BST). 

                    <br><br><span class="primary1"><b>Program structure and Design</b></span>
                    <br>
                    &emsp;&emsp; The structure type is called <b>address_t </b> similar to that used previously. 
                    In addition, <b>address_t </b>  will also contain the following two fields: <br>
                        
                        Struct address_t *leftChild, *rightChild;
                        
                    <br>&emsp;&emsp; As CS531_Inet.txt is being read in, the data will be stored in a BST composed of <b>address_t </b> structures containing 
                    the address/alias pairs read in from the file. Once the BST has been created, the user will receive the following menu options:
                        <br>
                        <br>&emsp;&emsp; 1) Add address
                        
                        <br>&emsp;&emsp; 2) Look up address
                        
                        <br>&emsp;&emsp; 3) Update address
                        
                        <br>&emsp;&emsp; 4) Delete address
                        
                        <br>&emsp;&emsp; 5) Display list
                        
                        <br>&emsp;&emsp; 6) Display aliases for location
                        
                        <br>&emsp;&emsp; 7) Save to file
                        
                        <br>&emsp;&emsp; 8) Quit
                        <br><br>

                    <b>Display list and Display aliases for location shall be based on Inorder Traversal</b>
                    <br>&emsp;&emsp; 1) Delete address, Look up address, and Display aliases for location; will display an error message if the address (or location) 
                    entered is not listed. Following the error &emsp;&emsp; message, the menu will be redisplayed.
                    <br>&emsp;&emsp; 2) A separate UDF (user defined function) will be defined for each menu option.
                    <br>&emsp;&emsp; 3) No duplicate aliases or address are allowed. If attempted, display an appropriate error message followed by the menu.
