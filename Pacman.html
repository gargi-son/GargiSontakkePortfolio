                  &emsp;&emsp;Adapted from the UC Berkeley curriculum, these
                  Pacman projects are done as part of the Introduction to
                  Artificial Intelligence coursework at George Mason University.
                  These projects are briefly divided into 4 sub-projects, each
                  of which deep dives into various concepts of Artificial
                  Intelligence: <br /><br />

                      >Project 1: Search( DFS, BFS, A*, UCS):
                    </span></b
                  ><br />
                  &emsp;&emsp;Project 1 starts with basic exercises of search
                  algorithms and uses the Pacman game as the reference to
                  explore different search algorithm concepts that are used in a
                  plethora of real-world applications.<br />
                  &emsp;&emsp;Here, the Pacman is programmed such that it
                  successfully satisfies various use cases like finding the food
                  dot in a maze using DFS, BFS, and A* algorithms; finding all
                  the corners by using heuristics functions, and many more.
                  These algorithms, implemented using python, are the basis of
                  almost every navigation problem in the real world.

                  &emsp;&emsp;Continuing with the Pacman maze game to explore
                  the artificial intelligence concepts, this project focuses on
                  modeling Pacman both as an adversarial as well as a stochastic
                  search problem. Using Python as the base programming language,
                  we designed Pacman along with external agents including
                  ghosts. This prepares the Pacman to take appropriate actions
                  in response to the randomness generated through these agents,
                  making it more intelligent. The actions taken are based on the
                  evaluation function logic coded for the Pacman, to evaluate
                  the state-action pairs.<br />
                  &emsp;&emsp;The search mechanisms used here, minimax and
                  expectimax, are a little more complex and use alpha-beta
                  pruning to explore the minimax tree. These form the basis of
                  the game theory and building game-playing agents, capable of
                  matching wits with the strongest human minds to play games
                  like chess and checkers.

                      >Project 3: Reinforcement Learning: Value Iteration,

                  ><br />
                  &emsp;&emsp;The goal of this project is to understand
                  Model-based and Model-free reinforcement learning algorithms
                  by implementing the concepts of value iteration and
                  q-learning.<br />
                  &emsp;&emsp;Q-learning enables the agent to learn from trial
                  and error from the interactions with the real environment
                  through its update method. We also introduce randomness to
                  best match the real-world scenarios and allow the q-learning
                  agent to make decisions based on the current q-state
                  values.<br />
                  &emsp;&emsp;The above concept is then applied to a robot
                  crawler, where the goal of the robot crawler is to move
                  forward, from point A to B. The crawler initially makes
                  mistakes, unable to achieve its goal, but with every
                  iteration, it learns and forms the best policy to move
                  forward.<br />
                  &emsp;&emsp;The other implementation of reinforcement learning
                  is in a game of PacMan, where it learns the values of
                  positions and actions by exploring every possible combination,
                  failing, and starting again. Once the training is complete,
                  Pacman is put in the testing environment where it achieves its
                  goal by the formulated policy.

                  ><br />
                  &emsp;&emsp;This last project advances into developing sensors
                  for Pacman to locate and eat invisible ghosts. The idea is to
                  make the Pacman intelligent, wherein it can predict not only
                  where the ghost may be, but also the possible ways in which
                  the ghost may move. To achieve this, we make use of exact and
                  approximate inference methods to update the agentâ€™s belief
                  distribution to help us track the ghosts better.
