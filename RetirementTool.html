              <h2 class="text-center">The Retirement <span class="primary1">Planning Model</span></h2>
              <p>
                <h5><b><span class="primary1"> Overview </span></b><br></h5>

                &emsp;&emsp; Retirement planning is crucial in providing for a person’s future financial stability. Among the preparation tools available,
                 none provide personalized recommendations to users. To explore solutions to this issue, we developed a retirement planning
                 tool, which computes detailed recommendations via three system features. The first feature diagnoses a person’s current retirement preparation status; 
                 the second recommends a pareto-optimal set of asset allocation weights and contribution amounts when each of the user’s accounts are distributed among 
                 three types of funds, US Stock, International Stock, and Bonds; and the third computes the investment amount required for a user to purchase an annuity at 
                 retirement. <br>
                
                &emsp;&emsp; There are both public and private retirement programs in the United States, and a complex web of account choices and legal requirements. 
                The public program includes the Social Security system and is financed by a pay-as-you-go principle. All employed people pay into the system to cover 
                the benefits of the recipients and at the same time build up their own pension entitlements for later. The pension entitlement depends on the payments 
                made and the number of years of contributions. All salaried employers as well as self-employed persons and freelancers are obliged to pay the contributions. 
                In addition to the retirement benefits, Social Security also guarantees access to medical treatment through Medicare, which is a public health insurance 
                program for elderly and disabled citizens[150].<br>

                &emsp;&emsp; However, the American Social Security system is more of a foundational safety net since it cannot fully maintain the quality of life in 
                old age. As a result, people usually need to supplement their old age pension themselves. For this reason, many tax-advantaged options for private 
                and employer pension plans are offered. Listed below are a few of them:<br>
                <ul>
                  <li>&emsp;<b>IRAs :</b> IRA stands for Individual Retirement Account. This is a long-term personal savings account that individuals with an income
                    can use to save for the future &emsp;and enjoy certain tax advantages. When an individual opens an IRA they may choose to invest in a wide range 
                    of financial products, including stocks, bonds, &emsp;exchange-traded funds(ETFs), and mutual funds. There are primarily four types of IRAs, 
                    depending on different rules regarding eligibility, taxation, and withdrawals: 
                    <br><br>
                    &emsp;<b>Traditional IRA:</b> This allows the user to contribute pre-tax dollars to the retirement account that can grow tax-deferred. 
                    The contributions to a traditional IRA may be tax deductible depending on factors such as taxpayer’s income, tax-filing status, etc. 
                    Unlike Roth IRA contributions, traditional IRA contributions are deductible from the current taxable income. So, if someone’s contribution 
                    to their IRA is $6000, they can claim that amount as a deduction on their income tax return and the Internal Revenue Service will not apply 
                    income tax to those earnings. However, when that individual withdraws money from the account during retirement, earnings are taxed at their 
                    ordinary income tax rate.<br>
                    &emsp;<b>Roth IRA:</b> This is a type of tax-advantaged individual retirement account funded with after-tax dollars. With a Roth IRA, contributions 
                    and earnings grow tax-free after the age of 59 and a half and can also be withdrawn without any taxes. The biggest distinction between Roth and 
                    Traditional IRAs is the way they both are taxed. Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars, meaning the contributions are not tax-deductible, 
                    but the investment may grow tax-free. The allowable investments in a Roth IRA includes mutual funds, stocks, bonds, exchange-traded funds(ETFs), 
                    certificates of deposit(CDs), money market funds, and even cryptocurrency. This type of IRA is best when the marginal taxes are higher in 
                    retirement than they are before it.<br>
                    &emsp;<b>Simplified Employee Pension(SEP) IRA: </b> This is a type suitable for small business owners and self-employed individuals, where the employer 
                    is allowed a tax-deduction for contributions made to a SEP IRA. The contributions are made to each eligible employee’s plan on a discretionary basis. 
                    The SEP IRAs have a higher annual contribution limit than the standard IRAs. They also can receive employer contributions like 401(k) and are treated 
                    like traditional IRAs for tax purposes and allow the same investment options. <br>
                    &emsp;<b>Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees(SIMPLE) IRA:</b> A SIMPLE IRA is a retirement savings plan that can be used by businesses with 100 or 
                    fewer employees. Employers have the choice of making a non-elective contribution of 2% of the employer’s salary or a dollar-for-dollar matching 
                    contribution of the employee’s contributions to plan up to 3% of their salary. This type of IRA is easy to set up, with just an initial plan document 
                    and annual disclosures to employees. Employers also get a tax deduction for the contributions they make for employees. One drawback of this type is 
                    that the business owner cannot save as much for retirement as with other small business retirement plans, such as the SEP or 401(k).<br>
                    &emsp;<b>Rollover IRA:</b> In this type of IRA, you contribute the money ‘rolled over’ from a qualified retirement plan into this traditional IRA. 
                    Rollovers involve moving eligible assets from an employer-sponsored plan such as a 401(k) or 403(b) into an IRA.
                  </li>
                  <br>
                  <li>&emsp;<b>401(k) : </b> This is a retirement savings plan offered by many American employers that allows employees to save and invest a 
                    portion of their paychecks before tax deductions. This is a company-sponsored retirement account to which both the employers and the employee 
                    contribute. With a 401k plan, a certain percentage of each paycheck is paid into this investment account and the employer may match part or all 
                    of that contribution. The 401(k) also has two categories based on how they are taxed: <br>
                    &emsp;<b>Traditional 401(k):</b> In the traditional 401(k), the employee contributions are deducted from the gross income meaning the money deducted 
                    comes from the employee’s payroll before the income taxes have been deducted. No taxes are due neither the money contributed or the investment 
                    earnings until the employee withdraws the money, usually in retirement. For example, if you earned $80,000 in 2021 and contributed $5000 towards 
                    towards 401(k), your taxable income will be reduced to $75,000. However, when you withdraw from your account in retirement, your contributions 
                    and investment earnings are generally fully taxable. <br>
                   &emsp;<b>Roth 401(k): </b> In the Roth 401(k), contributions towards the retirement account are deducted from the employee’s after-tax income. As a result, 
                    there is no tax deduction in the year of the year of contribution. When the money is withdrawn during retirement, no additional taxes are due 
                    on the employee’s contribution or the investment earnings. The primary difference between a 401(k) and an IRA is that an employer may offer a 
                    participant a 401(k), whereas individuals may purchase their own IRA. IRAs do not offer benefits like employer matching or a higher contribution 
                    limit, but they provide participants more flexibility and investment choices than a 401(k) can. 
                  </li>
                  <br>
                  <li>&emsp;<b>HSA :</b> HSA stands for Health Savings Account, which puts aside pre-tax dollars to be used on medical expenses, prescriptions or medical 
                    equipment. By using the untaxed dollars in a Health Savings Account to pay for deductibles, coinsurance and some other payments, one can lower 
                    their overall health care costs. However, an HSA is available only to individuals covered under high-deductible health plans(HDHP). 
                    A benefit of the HSA is that, while owned by an employee, it can be funded by the employer. HSA contributions may be invested, and unused account 
                    balances at year-end can be carried forward</li>
                  <li>&emsp;<b>Brokerage :</b> an individual account used to buy and sell securities such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds and ETFs. It gives the user 
                    direct access to the stock market and other related investments. Brokerage accounts are also called taxable investment accounts to differentiate 
                    them from tax-advantaged retirement accounts like 401(k)s. They can be used for day trading to earn short term profits as well as investing 
                    for long term goals.</li>
                  <li>&emsp;<b>Mutual Funds and ETFs : </b>ETFs are Exchange Traded funds, a pool or basket of securities that trades on an exchange just like a 
                    stock does. It can contain all types of investments including stocks, commodities or bonds and can either be actively or passively managed. 
                    ETFs trade like stocks and are primarily passive investments that seek to replicate the performance of a particular index. Passive ETFs tend 
                    to be tax efficient, in part because tracking an index usually does not require frequent trading.<br>
                    &emsp;Mutual funds are generally bought directly from investment companies instead of from other investors on an exchange. Unlike ETFs, they do not 
                    have trading commissions, but they do carry an expense ratio due to management and sales fees. Like ETFs, mutual funds may be actively or 
                    passively managed. Index mutual funds are considered passive investments because they mirror an index, but their performance may beat some 
                    but not all actively managed funds. The investments in an actively managed mutual fund are selected and managed by a portfolio manager.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                
                &emsp;&emsp; The inspiration for the system is the three-fund portfolio which is a simple retirement strategy that is employed by most major 
                brokerages’ Target Date Funds and championed by the Bogleheads. The Bogleheads are a group of fans of John Bogle, the founder of Vanguard and 
                creator of the first index 5 fund. Specifically, according to [38], the portfolio consists of three diverse, passively managed funds (as they 
                incur low cost):, one domestic stock, one international stock and one bond fund. We allow the user to select one fund for each of these categories.

                <br><br>&emsp;&emsp; We drew some inspiration for the features (including the structure of the GUI, and backend functionality) from a few current retirement
                calculators that are out there. We looked at Personal Finance Club’s Investment Growth Retirement Calculator which provides users with an estimate 
                of what they can expect their portfolio to grow to in retirement taking into account their cost of living, but it doesn’t provide the user with any 
                actionable information.

                <h5><b><span class="primary1"> System Architecture and Tools  </span></b></h5>
                <p>The application includes a Graphical User Interface (GUI), server, and backend. We implemented the GUI with the following tools:</p>
                <div class="row">
                  <div class = "col-lg-3 ">

                    <span class="primary1"><b>&emsp;Backend: </b> </span>
                    <ul>

                      <li>Heroku: For backend development</li>
                      <li>AWS EC2: For frontend hosting </li>
                    </ul> 
                  </div>           
                </div>
                &emsp;&emsp;We implemented the server with Flask, and the backend logic with other Python libraries, including Decision Guidance Analytics Language (DGAL) 
                , a module created to optimize the decision guiding functionality . Additionally, we deployed the server and backend on Heroku and the GUI on AWS EC2.
                <br>
                &emsp;&emsp;These system components interact in the following order: the GUI presents a form for user’s to input their retirement account information. 
                On submission, it forwards user input via fetch() Javascript functions to API routes on the server. These routes invoke the backend code to compute and 
                return results for the three features. Finally, the GUI presents these results to the user. The following sections will explain the implementation logic
                of each feature in the backend.

                <span class="primary1"><b> Optimal Asset Allocation and contribution feature </b></span>
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;After diagnosing the user’s financial status, if their current salary is greater than their spending and tax amounts, the backend 
                computes a range of pareto-optimal asset allocations and contributions in the following manner. First, the backend uses user input to construct a 
                mathematical model representing the user’s retirement account portfolio. Afterwards, it invokes the DGAL engine which retrieves results (to construct 
                a set of pareto optimal points) by running the linear optimizer, GLPK, on a Pyomo representation of the model.
                
                <br><br><span class="primary1"><b> Model</b></span><br>
                &emsp;&emsp;According to the Operations Research perspective a mathematical model must represent an actual system in 
                the form of mathematical equations which specify metrics and constraints on decision variables. Applying this knowledge, we created two models: 
                <b>single account model</b> and <b>combined account model</b> (these models’ implementations are in functions, singleAccountMod and combiningAccountsMod, 
                respectively, in the [modelcode.py](http://modelcode.py/) file). Each single account model represents a different retirement account. When combined, 
                these models’ outputs form metrics and constraints for one combined account model, which represents the user’s retirement account portfolio.
                        
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;We formed each model’s metrics and constraints to represent the domain constructs on actual retirement accounts. In
                general, the user’s goal is to maximize their portfolio’s balance by retirement (to ensure they are taking maximum
                advantage of the retirement accounts available to them and to maintain their savings until death). Every retirement account’s balance 
                increases when the rate of return and contribution amount (deposited by the user) are large. Higher return securities undergo higher 
                volatility, which is defined as the variation in returns. Thus, a higher return may decrease drastically, producing losses for the user’s 
                account over time. Additional losses on the account are incurred if the user invests in funds with high expense ratios (which charge high 
                maintenance fees) . 

                <br>&emsp;&emsp;Applying the domain knowledge we gained through research we derived various variables, metrics, and constraints to represent 
                the model. First, we identified decision and fixed variables for the models. The user’s decision variables (which directly influence their objective 
                to maximize account balance by retirement) include weights of securities each account is distributed amongst, and the yearly contribution amount to 
                each account. The fixed variables in the model (which encode the user’s current situation) include the user’s pre retirement salary, spending, and 
                taxes, years until the user retires (called X), the expected return and standard deviation over the X year period for each chosen security (US
                Stock, International Stock, and Total Bond funds) in every inputted retirement account, and legal limits on contribution amounts.
                  
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;Afterwards, we formed metrics and constraints in terms of these variables for each model. The single account model
                computes the main metrics: portfolio expected return, portfolio standard deviation (which is a common metric for
                volatility, among other risk metrics such as beta and sharpe ratio) , total account balance by retirement, and total cost incurred on the 
                account by retirement. The single account model constraints limit the weights of each security in the account to be between 0 and 1, and the 
                yearly contributions to be within a user’s budget and IRS legal limits. As for the combined account model, the model computes totals of the 
                metrics outputted from single account model and adds a constraint limiting the total yearly contribution to all accounts to be
                within the user’s budget. Besides these primary metrics, the models compute linear proxies representing the growth of each retirement
                account and the standard deviation. We use these proxies in objective functions to produce the pareto optimal front of asset allocations.
                  
                <br><br><b><span class="primary1">Pareto Optimal Front </span></b>
                <br>&emsp;&emsp; As implied previously, there is a direct linear relation between standard deviation (volatility) and expected return. 
                In general, risk averse users (seeking to preserve their investment) are willing to compromise expected return for a
                lower standard deviation in their account. Thus, financial advisors recommend users allocate more of
                their accounts into set proportions of stocks and bonds based on their level of risk. Additionally, sources recommend that to maximize 
                retirement account balance, users start with a high stock allocation in their youth and allocate more towards bonds as they approach retirement.
                
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;In order to balance this financial advice with the user’s preference for risk within their current situation, the system allows the user to 
                select their asset allocation from a pareto-optimal range (i.e., where only one metric (standard deviation or expected return) has an optimal value). 
                Specifically, after the user completes form submission, the GUI presents up to 5 (X,Y) coordinates (computed in the backend), where each X coordinate 
                corresponds to the cumulative expected return on the user’s retirement account portfolio, and each Y coordinate corresponds to the account balance 
                accumulated by retirement for the expected return represented by X. Additionally, the graph displays minimum and maximum values for the Y 
                coordinate, which correspond to the account balance accumulated by retirement when expected return varies by three standard deviations. 
                
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;Thus, the graph displays a 99% confidence interval of account balance by retirement for each point. To compute these points, the backend utilized 
                the paretoOptimal algorithm. The following explains the application of this algorithm to compute points. First, the system utilizes DGAL to 
                derive the minimum and maximum values for the two metric proxies described in Table 2 for the combined account model: Total Growth of all Accounts 
                by Retirement (Proxy) and Standard Deviation of all Accounts (Proxy). The code sets these linear proxies as objective functions to incorporate 
                all decision variables in each retirement account model and utilize GLPK. (Thus, the system runs DGAL 4 times, with each
                objective function, objective (if minimizing the objective function, dgal.min() executes, else dgal.max() executes ), and the combined model). 
                
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;The system then computes each point by running DGAL (<b>the max()</b> function) with the objective function below (which combines the normalized 
                proxies) with a different angle. So, to compute 5 points, the system runs DGAL 5 more times: 
                <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;for point 1: angle= (1* (89))/5, 
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;for point 2: angle = (2* (89))/5, and
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;for point 5: angle = (5 * (89))/5 
                <br> <b>Then, </b>
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;Xnormalized cos(angle) + Ynormalized sin(angle) where
                
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;Xnormalized= (Total Growth of all Accounts by Retirement Proxy - min X) /( max X - min X)
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;Ynormalized = (total standard deviation of all accounts proxy - min Y)/(max Y - min Y) ,
                  
                <br><br><i>&emsp;&emsp;min Y, max Y, min X, and max X are the optimal values for the proxies
                (the minimum and maximum values computed when the objective function is one proxy, which is computed in the first part of the algorithm)</i>
                <br> <b>Also, </b>

                <br>&emsp;&emsp;angle = (i * (90 - 1)/n), where i = point number, n = total number of points generating on the graph
                (the angle is computed like so to find coordinates of all n points distributed within the 90 degree angle space)
                
                <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;Each optimization takes 20 seconds to complete. So, to avoid timeout errors we distributed these calls for optimization among different api 
                routes in the server, which the GUI uses to fetch this data.
                  
                <br><br><b><span class="primary1">Annuity Feature </span></b>
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;Another option we provide to the users is annuities, which is an ideal alternative to choosing asset
                  allocations for risk averse users, due to their low returns and risk. As for computation, based on the user’s expected spending in retirement,
                  we calculate the amount needed to purchase an annuity that would provide that level of consistent spending throughout retirement 
                  (similar to the function of the Brighthouse Financial Calculator). We used the Payout Annuity Formula from [annuity.org](http://annuity.org/) 
                  to calculate this principal.
                  In the picture below , r = return rate we set it at the average which is 2% , n = 12
                  (for monthly payments), t = years until death, PMT is the monthly payout of the annuity, which we set to the user
                  input of expected annual spending in retirement divided by 12 to get the monthly expected spending in retirement.
                  This ensures that the annuity purchased will cover the user’s spending in retirement.
